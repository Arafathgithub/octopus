Here is the plan to create a reactflow orchestrator application to orchestrate ml operations based on mlflow pipeline with a no code low code, nice and intuitive drag and drop user interface

Application: MLflow Pipeline Orchestrator
This application will provide a web-based, drag-and-drop interface to define and run MLflow pipelines.

1. Frontend (Client-Side):
Framework: React (using Vite for a fast development environment).
UI Components:
ReactFlow: For the core drag-and-drop pipeline editor.
Material-UI (MUI): To create a polished, modern, and intuitive user interface with a professional look and feel.
User Experience:
A sidebar will contain a list of available MLflow pipeline steps (e.g., ingest, split, train, evaluate) as draggable nodes.
A central canvas where users can drag these nodes and connect them to define the pipeline's execution graph.
A properties panel that appears when a node is selected, allowing users to configure the parameters for that specific step (the "low-code" aspect).
A toolbar with buttons to "Run Pipeline," "Save," and "Load."
A status/output area to display logs and results from the pipeline execution.
2. Backend (Server-Side):
Framework: Python with FastAPI. It's a modern, high-performance web framework that is perfect for creating the necessary API endpoints.
Functionality:
Provide API endpoints for the frontend to fetch available pipeline steps.
Receive the pipeline definition (as a JSON graph) from the frontend.
Translate the JSON graph into a sequence of mlflow commands.
Execute the MLflow pipeline using Python's subprocess module to call the mlflow run command.
Stream logs and results from the MLflow execution back to the frontend.
3. Core Features & Design:
Visual Pipeline Editor: Drag, drop, and connect nodes to build ML workflows visually.
Configurable Steps: Click any node to open a form where you can edit its specific parameters (e.g., data source, hyperparameters).
One-Click Execution: A "Run" button to trigger the entire pipeline on the backend.
Real-time Feedback: View the logs and status of the running pipeline directly in the UI.
Aesthetic: A clean, modern interface based on Material Design principles to ensure it is intuitive and pleasant to use.# octopus
